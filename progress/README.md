# Weekly Progress Presentations

This folder contains all the presentations I create to document my progress throughout the project, organized by week.

Each presentation highlights the work completed, key insights, challenges faced, and next steps. These documents serve both as a personal log and as a reference for collaborators and supervisors.

Feel free to explore the weekly files to follow the development of the project over time.
